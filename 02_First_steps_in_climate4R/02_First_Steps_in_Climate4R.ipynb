    "# First Steps in Climate4R\n",
    "\n",
    "In this jupyter `R` notebook we describe the main basics of 3 core climate4R libraries, namely `loadeR`, `transformeR` and `visualizeR`. The main functionalities of each library are:\n",
    "* `loadeR`: is an `R` package for climate data access building on the NetCDF-Java API. It allows user-friendly data access either from local or remote locations (e.g. OPeNDAP servers) and it is fully integrated with the User Data Gateway (UDG), a Climate Data Service deployed and maintained by the Santander Meteorology Group. loadeR has been conceived to work in the framework of both seasonal forecasting and climate change studies. Thus, it considers ensemble members as a basic dimension of its two main data structures (grid and station). Find out more about this package at the [loadeR wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki).\n",
    "* `transformeR`: is an `R` package for climate data manipulation and transformation including subsetting, regridding and data conversion. Find out more about this package at the [transformeR wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR/wiki).\n",
    "* `visualizeR`: is an `R` package for climate data visualization, with special focus on ensemble forecasting and uncertainty communication. It includes functions for visualizing climatological, forecast and evaluation products, and combinations of them. Find out more about this package at the [visualizeR wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR/wiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the notebook, the user would have acquired basic competences on the use of these libraries. We refer the reader to either the GitHub climate4R repository (https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) and the main reference manuscript [1] for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is divided in 2 different parts:\n",
    " * [Basic operations with climate4R](#Basic-operations-with-climate4R)\n",
    " * [Case study: Computing climate change signals of global climate simulations with climate4R](#Case-study:-Computing-climate-change-signals-of-global-climate-simulations-with-climate4R)\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we load the `R` libraries (please see module [01_Introduction](../01_Introduction) and/or the climate4R GitHub site (https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) for guidelines on the installation of the climate4R packages).\n"

Nevertheless, `loadeR` also permits to load climate data from `.txt` files (this will be reviewed in future notebooks).\n",
