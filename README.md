# climate4R training course material

This repository contains training material for a climate4R introductory course held in Buenos Aires (2022) covering the following topics:

 1. [Introduction:](./01_Introduction) Prerequisites and different installation and usage options.
 
 2. [First steps in climate4R:](./02_First_steps_in_climate4R) Climate data access, management, interpolation, processing and visualization in different formats (station data, reanalysis, regional and global climate model simulations).

 3. [Downscaling of future climate projections:](./03_Downscaling) Introduction to different statistical bias correction and downscaling techniques (algorithmic, regression-based and machine learning).

 4. [Evaluation of climate projections and impacts:](./04_Impact_indices) Computation of climate impact indices, with an example on future projections of the SPEI drought index.

 5. [Seasonal forecasting:](./05_Seasonal_forecasting) Seasonal forecast access and loading, ensemble forecast mangement, visualization and verification of probabilistic predictions.

 6. [Interactive Atlas IPCC y notebooks:](./06_IPCC_AR6_Interactive_Atlas) Presentation of the Interactive Atlas and its components. Climate synthesis in different AR6 regions, integration with climate4R, computation of ETCCDI indices for climate extremes.
